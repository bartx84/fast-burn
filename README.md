fast-burn
====

This script allows you to burn to CD or DVD iso or directory by simply typing fast-burn /your/image.iso or fast-burn /your/directory. I will add the function to make dvd from avi/divx and music CD from mp3. 

Also is possible to write iso or directory typing cd /iso/or/dir/directory and fast-burn image.iso or fast-burn your_directory
